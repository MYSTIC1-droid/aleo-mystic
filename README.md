A standard game of Scribble in leo is a fun and fast-paced drawing and guessing game that can be enjoyed by people of all ages. Here are the basic rules of the game:
Materials:
A set of Scribble cards or a list of words
Paper and pencils for each player
A timer (optional)
Objective:
The goal of the game is to be the first player to reach a certain number of points (usually 10 points). Points are awarded for correctly guessing the word that another player is drawing.
Gameplay:
Set up: Each player should have a piece of paper and a pencil. One player should be designated as the "drawer" and the other players should be the "guessers." The drawer should take a Scribble card or look at a word from the list.
Drawing: The drawer should set a timer for 60 seconds (or a shorter time if desired) and start drawing the word on their paper. The drawer should not speak or give any clues to the guessers.
Guessing: The guessers should try to guess the word that the drawer is drawing. They can shout out their guesses at any time, but if they are wrong, they are out for that round.
Scoring: If a guesser correctly guesses the word before the timer goes off, they score 1 point. If the timer goes off before a guesser correctly guesses the word, the drawer scores 1 point.
Next round: The next player becomes the drawer, and a new word is drawn.
Additional rules:
The drawer can draw anything they want, but they should avoid drawing words that are too easy or too difficult.
If a guesser shouts out a word that is close to the correct word, the drawer can give them a clue by saying "hot" or "cold."
If a guesser accuses another guesser of cheating, they can ask the drawer to verify the guess. If the drawer confirms that the guess is correct, the accused guesser is out for the round.
Tips:
Use simple and recognizable shapes when drawing.
Break down complex words into smaller parts.
Use gestures to help the guessers.
Have fun!
